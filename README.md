# Console_Bingo_Caller
C# project. The player can use the call function to call a random number. The number and its call are printed to the console for the caller to read aloud for the bingo players. E.G. Number 22, two little ducks. Caller can also use check function to check a player's number against all the balls called so far and determine if they have won a line or bingo.
